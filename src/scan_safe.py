Hence it verifies the cert chain to ensure it is valid and no common errors like expired certs, self-signed certs, or hostname mismatches that commonly occur in real-world scenarios occur in the cert presented by the server.
    
    Common errors that can occur:
    - Expired Certificate: The certificate's validity period has ended.
    - Self-Signed Certificate: The certificate is signed by the same entity that created it, rather than a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
    - Untrusted CA: The certificate is signed by a CA that is not in the client's trusted CA list.
    - Hostname Mismatch: The hostname in the URL does not match the Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Names (SAN) in the certificate.
    
    CVEs related to TLS/SSL misconfigurations:
    - CVE-2014-3566 (POODLE): A vulnerability in SSL 3.0 that allows an attacker to decrypt secure connections.
    - CVE-2015-0204 (FREAK): A vulnerability that allows attackers to force a downgrade of the encryption used in SSL/TLS connections.
    - CVE-2016-2107: A padding oracle attack against AES-NI based implementations of AES-CBC in TLS.
    - CVE-2018-0732: A vulnerability in OpenSSL that could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code.
    - CVE-2020-1967: A vulnerability in OpenSSL's handling of TLS 1.3 that could allow an attacker to crash the server or client.
    - CVE-2021-3449: A NULL pointer dereference in OpenSSL's TLS 1.3 implementation that could lead to a denial of service.
    - CVE-2021-3711 (High): A buffer overflow in OpenSSL's ChaCha20-Poly1305 implementation that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

    These automated checks are non-exploitative and safe to run on production systems.
    They do not attempt any authentication or intrusive actions. They only read banners and server responses.
    
    THe purpose of this function is to scan a specific port on a given host using a TCP socket connection. It attempts to connect to the specified port and, if successful, performs a series of safe automated checks to gather information about the service running on that port. The findings from these checks are then compiled into a structured format and appended to the provided result list.
    
    The checks inlude:
    - Basic banner grabbing to identify the service.
    - Port-specific safe checks (e.g., HTTP headers, TLS cert info, SMTP STARTTLS support).
    - Mapping the port to potential findings and remediation suggestions.
    The function handles various exceptions to ensure that any connection issues or unexpected errors are captured and reported in the results.
    
    The significance of this function lies in its ability to provide a comprehensive overview of the services running on a target host without causing disruption or requiring authentication. This makes it suitable for use in production environments where safety and non-intrusiveness are paramount.

    These kinds of checks are useful for:
    - Service Identification: Understanding what services are running on which ports.
    - Security Assessments: Identifying potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
    - Compliance Checks: Ensuring that services are properly configured and not exposing unnecessary information.
    - Network Diagnostics: Verifying that services are up and responding as expected.

    It is for light reconnaissance and should not be used for aggressive scanning or exploitation.

    SSL/TLS and SMTP are two different protocols used for secure communication over networks, but they serve different purposes and operate at different layers of the network stack. 
    SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security):
    - Purpose: SSL/TLS is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over a network. It is used to encrypt data transmitted between a client and a server, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.
    - Layer: SSL/TLS operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model, sitting between the application layer (Layer 7) and the transport layer (Layer 4).
    - Usage: SSL/TLS is commonly used to secure web traffic (HTTPS), email (SMTPS, IMAPS, POP3S), and other protocols that require secure communication.
    - Functionality: SSL/TLS provides encryption, authentication (via certificates), and data integrity checks.

    SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):
    - Purpose: SMTP is a protocol used for sending and receiving email messages between mail servers. It is not inherently secure and does not provide encryption or authentication by itself.
    - Layer: SMTP operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model.
    - Usage: SMTP is used for sending email messages from a client to a mail server or between mail servers. It is often used in conjunction with other protocols like IMAP or POP3 for retrieving email.
    - Functionality: SMTP defines how email messages are formatted and transmitted, but it does not include any security features.

    We separated the checks for SSL/TLS and SMTP because they address different aspects of network communication and security. SSL/TLS focuses on securing the communication channel itself, while SMTP is concerned with the transmission of email messages. By performing separate checks for each protocol, we can gather relevant information about both the security of the communication channel (via SSL/TLS) and the configuration and capabilities of the email service (via SMTP). This comprehensive approach helps in identifying potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in both areas.

    Potential inclusions of more protocols in the future:
    - FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Check for anonymous login and banner grabbing.
    - SSH (Secure Shell): Banner grabbing and checking for weak configurations (without attempting authentication).
    - Telnet: Banner grabbing (note: Telnet is insecure and should be avoided in favor of SSH).
    - POP3/IMAP: Banner grabbing and checking for STARTTLS support.
    - RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol): Banner grabbing (limited info available).
    - MySQL/PostgreSQL: Banner grabbing and version detection (without attempting authentication).
    - VNC (Virtual Network Computing): Banner grabbing (limited info available).
